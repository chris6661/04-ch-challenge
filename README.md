# JavaScript Coding Challenge

## This project is a quiz for taking a javascript quiz created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a set time limit, there are multiple choice questions, and any time a wrong answer is selected time is deducted off the final score at the end of the game. The game ends either when all questions have been answered or the user runs out of time.

## At the end of the game, the user is prompted to enter their intials and record both their initials and score on a local device. The user can then review previous high scores and also has the option of clearing the high score history out.
